# Java #

Java is an environment for creation and execution of applications working on all common operating systems. You can download it at [java.com](http://java.com/download). A more detailed way for some systems is described below. You can verify a correct Java installation by using button [Verify Installation](http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp).

## Linux ##
> Most Linux distributions contain Java in their repositories, usually called OpenJDK. The popular Ubuntu has it installed by default. If you don't have it installed, use your package management software to install it.

> You can also use official Oracle Java available from their website [java.com](http://java.com/download) (only RPM packages are provided however).

## Mac OS X ##
> Java is already bundled to application so you don't need to install anything. The only requirement is Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or later. This is everything you need to launch Esemska application.

If you are running Esmska for first time, hold Control key and click on Esmska icon. Then hold Control and click on Open. After that, information dialog will pop and you need to click on Open button. The reason is that Esmska is (and never will be) signed by registered Apple developer.

## Windows ##
> On the [java.com](http://java.com/download) page click on **Free Java Download**. If you use _Internet Explorer_ click on the **Install ActiveX component** on the upper yellow bar and then **Install**. If you use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) click on **Download now**, on upper yellow bar click **Modify settings** → **Allow** → **Close**, again **Download now** and **Install now**.
