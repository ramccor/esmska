<tr><td><i>There are currently no developers available who would have enough time to work on Esmska. I'll still accept reasonable patches, but won't work on them myself. If you want to have something fixed, you need to provide a patch yourself, or wait until someone does that for you. If you feel like taking over Esmska maintenance, you are very welcome, contact me.</i> </td></tr></table>

You can report bugs by creating a new issue. **Before that** please do the following things:

  1. Check that you are using [latest program version](http://code.google.com/p/esmska/wiki/Download?tm=2).
  1. See [FAQ](FAQ.md) and [Problems](Problems.md).
  1. See the [Changelog](Changelog.md) if your problem has not been already solved in the development version.
  1. Search the [list of all issues](http://code.google.com/p/esmska/issues/list?can=1) if somebody has not already reported your problem.
  1. **If you have a problem with a gateway** then first of all check whether the message can be sent over the [web pages](Problems#Gateway_doesn%27t_work.md) of that gateway. If not, the program can't work either, because it uses the web gateway internally.

Do you still believe you are the first one with the problem? OK, then ![http://wiki.esmska.googlecode.com/git/icons/issue.png](http://wiki.esmska.googlecode.com/git/icons/issue.png) **[report a new issue](http://code.google.com/p/esmska/issues/entry)**.
